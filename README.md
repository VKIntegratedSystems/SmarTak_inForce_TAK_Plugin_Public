### Why will ATAK not install on my device?

If you have downloaded the Google Play Store version of ATAK, it is possible the application may be incompatible with the hardware on your device. This version of ATAK is a stripped down variant meant to comply with file size limitations of the Google Play Store. A likely fix would be to download the ATAK-Civ APK available at: [tak.gov](https://tak.gov/) (free account creation required)
        
### Why will SmarTak inForce not install on my device?

Confirm your versions of ATAK and SmarTak inForce are compatible. If your device claims SmarTak inForce is already installed, use your App explorer on your device to ensure SmarTak inForce is not currently on the device. Be sure to check all profiles on your device if you have more than one. If SmarTak inForce is show in your App explorer, uninstall and attempt to install again.   

### Devices are not showing up to pair
   
Confirm that Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Make sure the SIOS device is powered on. If needed, check the app permissions for ATAK on your device. Ensure that location and bluetooth permissions are enabled for the app.

Reference the compatibility matrix listed [above](compatibility)
