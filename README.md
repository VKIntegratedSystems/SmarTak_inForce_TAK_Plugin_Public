- [Why will SmarTak inForce not install on my device?](#Why-will-smartak-inforce-not-install-on-my-device)

- [Alternative operating systems](#alternative-operating-systems)

### Why will ATAK not install on my device?

If you have downloaded the Google Play Store version of ATAK, it is possible the application may be incompatible with the hardware on your device. This version of ATAK is a stripped down variant meant to comply with file size limitations of the Google Play Store. A likely fix would be to download the ATAK-Civ APK available at: [ATAK-Civ via TAK Stack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.takstack&pcampaignid=web_share)
        
### Why will SmarTak inForce not install on my device?

Confirm your versions of ATAK and SmarTak inForce are compatible. If your device claims SmarTak inForce is already installed, use your App explorer on your device to ensure SmarTak inForce is not currently on the device. Be sure to check all profiles on your device if you have more than one. If SmarTak inForce is shown in your App explorer, uninstall and attempt to install again.   

### Devices are not showing up to pair
   
Confirm that Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Make sure the SIOS device is powered on. If needed, check the app permissions for ATAK on your device. Ensure that location and bluetooth permissions are enabled for the app.
      
### ATAK and SmarTak inForce version compatibility
   
Reference the compatibility matrix listed [above](#compatibility)
        
### Alternative operating systems
   
ATAK and SmarTak inForce will run on variations of the Android Operating System (such as Graphene OS). ATAK and SmarTak inForce are not compatible with iOS (Apple) or any other non-Android OS. There is a form of TAK, iTAK, that will run on iOS devices, but functionality for the usage of plugins has not yet been added. In an attempt to bridge this gap, [TAK Stack for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tak-stack/id6471518626) has some of the functionality of the inForce plugin.
